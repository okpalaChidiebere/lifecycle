# LiFECYCLE
The Purpose of this app is to understand App [lifecycle](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appstate#app-states) for react native


# BootStraping the Application
- There are some certain features that expo has not supported yet but you can still write native code in swift for ios or Java/kotlin for android to use those features in your create-react-native-app template that [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) bootstrap template does not allow that. Also Expo is adding these faetures, but you still want to have the option of writing native code in java or swift for your mobile app. 
- The official way of building react-Native apps is using create-react-native-app template. Then down the line, when or if you decide to use some [Expo APIs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v41.0.0/sdk/accelerometer/) in your create-react-native-app, all you have to do is install the package and use them!. To bootstrap the template run `npx create-react-native-app <App-NAME>`
